1. Install the composer package:
    ```sh
    composer require mikebronner/laravel-sign-in-with-apple
    ```

    We also recommend using [geneaLabs/laravel-socialiter](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-socialiter)
    to automatically manage user resolution and persistence:

    ```sh
    composer require genealabs/laravel-socialiter
    ```

<a name="Configuration"></a>
## Configuration

1. Create an `App ID` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId) with the following details:
    - Platform: iOS, tvOS, watchOS (I'm unsure if either choice has an effect for web apps)
    - Description: (something like "example.com app id")
    - Bundle ID (Explicit): com.example.id (or something similar)
    - Check "Sign In With Apple"
2. Create a `Service ID` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) with the following details:
    - Description: (something like "example.com service id")
    - Identifier: com.example.service (or something similar)
    - Check "Sign In With Apple"
    - Configure "Sign In With Apple":
        - Primary App Id: (select the primary app id created in step 1)
        - Web Domain: example.com (the domain of your web site)
        - Return URLs: https://example.com/apple-signin (the route pointing to the callback method in your controller)
        - Click "Save".
        - Click the "Edit" button to edit the details of the "Sign In With Apple"
            configuration we just created.
        - If you haven't verified the domain yet, download the verification file,
            upload it to https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt, and then click the "Verify"
            button.
3. Create a `Private Key` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) with the following details:
    - Key Name:
    - Check "Sign In With Apple"
    - Configure "Sign In With Apple":
        - Primary App ID: (select the primary app id created in step 1)
        - Click "Save"
    - Click "Continue"
    - Click "Register"
    - Click "Download"
    - Rename the downloaded file to `key.txt`
4. Create your app's client secret:
    - Install the JWT Gem:
        ```sh
        sudo gem install jwt
        ```

    - Create a file called `client_secret.rb` to process the private key:
        ```ruby
        require 'jwt'

        key_file = 'key.txt'
        team_id = ''
        client_id = ''
        key_id = ''

        ecdsa_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new IO.read key_file

        headers = {
        'kid' => key_id
        }

        claims = {
            'iss' => team_id,
            'iat' => Time.now.to_i,
            'exp' => Time.now.to_i + 86400*180,
            'aud' => 'https://appleid.apple.com',
            'sub' => client_id,
        }

        token = JWT.encode claims, ecdsa_key, 'ES256', headers

        puts token
        ```

    - Fill in the following fields:
        - `team_id`: This can be found on the top-right corner when logged into
            your Apple Developer account, right under your name.
        - `client_id`: This is the identifier from the Service Id created in step
            2 above, for example com.example.service
        - `key_id`: This is the identifier of the private key created in step 3
            above.
    - Save the file and run it from the terminal. It will spit out a JWT which is
        your client secret, which you will need to add to your `.env` file in the
        next step.
        ```sh
        ruby client_secret.rb
        ```

5. Set the necessary environment variables in your `.env` file:

    ```env
    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_LOGIN="/apple/login/controller/login/action"
    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_REDIRECT="/apple/login/controller/callback/action"
    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_CLIENT_ID="your app's service id as registered with Apple"
    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your app's client secret as calculated in step 4"
    ```

## Implementation

<a name="LoginButton"></a>
### Button

Add the following blade directive to your login page:

```php
@signInWithApple($color, $hasBorder, $type, $borderRadius)
```

| Parameter | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| $color    | String, either "black" or "white. |
| $hasBorder | Boolean, either `true` or `false`. |
| $type      | String, either `"sign-in"` or `"continue"`. |
| $borderRadius | Integer, greater or equal to 0. |

<a name="Controller"></a>
### Controller

This implementation uses Socialite to get the login credentials. The following is an example implementation of the controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use GeneaLabs\LaravelSocialiter\Facades\Socialiter;
use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;

class AppleSigninController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('guest')->except('logout');
    }

    public function login()
    {
        return Socialite::driver("sign-in-with-apple")
            ->scopes(["name", "email"])
            ->redirect();
    }

    public function callback(Request $request)
    {
        // get abstract user object, not persisted
        $user = Socialite::driver("sign-in-with-apple")
            ->user();

        // or use Socialiter to automatically manage user resolution and persistence
        $user = Socialiter::driver("sign-in-with-apple")
            ->login();
    }
}
```

Note that when processing the returned `$user` object, it is critical to know that the `sub` element is the unique identifier for the user, **NOT** the email address.

## If you ❤️ open-source software, give the repos you use a ⭐️.
We have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev dependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring the packages you use. Simply run `composer thanks` after installing this package. (And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your live environment.)
